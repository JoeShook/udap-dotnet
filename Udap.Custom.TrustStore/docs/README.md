## ðŸ“¦ This package

This package would be used if your target OS is Windows and you cannot load certificates into the Windows Certificate Store.  Currently this package is not used by in any code or examples.  It will most likely be removed in favor of new abilities in dotnet core that allow us to load our own custom trust store.

Actually this is not a published package.
