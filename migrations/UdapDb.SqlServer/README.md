# udap-dotnet

### udap-dotnet migrations.

Run buildSchema.bat to regenerate migrations.  It will place migrations in Udap/Server folder

Note: Identity Server migrations were generated from the Duende source code and place in the Migrations folder.  In the future I might generate them from here.


Deploy the schema by simple running the application.

```Dotnet run```
